Hi Benjamin,

Thanks again for meeting today. Attached is an updated proposal with changes we discussed at our 
meeting. Also brain atrophy and prior PK study result with accepted draft manuscript.

Few additional points. The initial proposal didn’t clarify that we are comparing R-LA blood PK 
parameters (peak levels, bioavailability, etc.) between the pure R-LA form and the racemic (mix R and S) 
LA. It doesn’t change anything about the calculations but you will see those changes and I wanted to 
explain.

Also I’m not totally clear if project 1 will test both 600mg and 1200mg R-LA or just the 600mg. I recall 
you said adding the 1200 arm makes analysis more complicated? Correct me if I’m wrong. I’ll clarify the 
number of arms for Project 1 asap. If you need to know now, assume 3, 10 subjects each. 

Best regards,
Becca
